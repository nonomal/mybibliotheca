"""
Metadata Aggregator facade.

This module provides a stable import path for unified book metadata
aggregation. It delegates to app.utils.unified_metadata which merges
Google Books and OpenLibrary data and normalizes dates.

Use cases:
- fetch_unified_by_isbn(isbn): merged metadata for a single ISBN
- fetch_unified_by_title(title, max_results=10): ranked search results

Note: Prefer importing from this module in new code to make future
internal changes transparent to callers.
