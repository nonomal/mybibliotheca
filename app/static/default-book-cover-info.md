# Default Book Cover Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the default book cover image. In a real implementation, you would place a default book cover image here at:

/Users/jeremiah/Documents/Python Projects/bibliotheca/app/static/default-book-cover.png

For now, the timeline will gracefully handle missing cover images by showing colored rectangles instead.

You can add a default book cover image by:
1. Creating or finding a suitable book cover placeholder image
2. Saving it as `default-book-cover.png` in the `app/static/` directory
3. The timeline will automatically use it for books without cover images
