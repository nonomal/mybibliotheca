# Cover Download Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Book cover images were not being persisted to disk when added to the Bibliotheca app. The database would store cover URLs pointing to `/static/covers/` but the actual image files were missing from the filesystem.

## Root Cause
The cover download code had inconsistent path resolution:
- **Correct implementation**: Used `current_app.static_folder` which resolved to `/Users/jeremiah/Documents/Python Projects/bibliotheca/app/static/covers`
- **Incorrect implementation**: Used relative path `Path('static/covers')` which resolved to `/Users/jeremiah/Documents/Python Projects/bibliotheca/static/covers` (wrong directory)

## Fix Applied
Updated the second cover download implementation in `app/routes/book_routes.py` (around line 2497) to use the same consistent path resolution as the first implementation:

```python
# BEFORE (incorrect)
covers_dir = Path('static/covers')

# AFTER (correct)  
static_folder = current_app.static_folder or 'app/static'
covers_dir = Path(static_folder) / 'covers'
```

## Additional Fix
Fixed a template routing issue in `view_book_enhanced.html` where the delete book button was trying to use `main.delete_book` instead of the correct `book.delete_book` route.

## Verification
1. **Manual test passed**: Created and ran `test_cover_download_manual.py` which successfully:
   - Downloaded a test image from `https://httpbin.org/image/jpeg`
   - Saved it to the correct location: `/Users/jeremiah/Documents/Python Projects/bibliotheca/app/static/covers/`
   - Verified the file exists and persists (35,588 bytes)

2. **File persistence confirmed**: The downloaded test file `a3884c29-feed-4739-977e-bc999a525d1f.jpg` remains in the covers directory across app restarts.

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Cover images will now be properly downloaded and persisted to disk when books are added to the library.

## Next Steps for Testing
After resetting the database, add a new book with a cover URL and verify:
1. The cover image is downloaded and saved to `app/static/covers/`
2. The image file persists across app restarts
3. The cover displays correctly in the web interface

## Files Modified
- `app/routes/book_routes.py` - Fixed path resolution for cover downloads
- `app/templates/view_book_enhanced.html` - Fixed delete book route reference
- Created test scripts for verification: `test_cover_download_manual.py`
